# Transposons as genome ecology — ROADMAP

**Canonical for "what phase, what's next".** If a later document supersedes this
one, banner this file and redirect from it in the same commit.

## Where this stands

**Nothing is designed yet.** Scaffolded 2026-09-01 so development could start;
no model, no registered question, no measurement.

## The constraint that shapes everything else

⚠️⚠️ **The player moves a LINEAGE'S EVOLVABLE STRATEGY, not an element making
choices. Transposition rate is HERITABLE, NOT A DECISION.**

This is not flavour. It rules out the most obvious design — a player who chooses
when to copy — because that models something biology does not do. The verb has to
be "carry a strategy and be selected", and finding a verb that is both accurate
and playable is the central design problem, not a detail to settle later.

## The first decision

⚠️ **What is the individual?** Three candidates, and the choice is not obvious:

| unit           | what a "player" then is                | what gets lost                            |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| element copy   | one insertion's fate                   | the strategy is invisible at this scale   |
| element FAMILY | a lineage with a heritable rate        | within-family variation                   |
| genome/host    | the suppressor's side of the arms race | the parasite is no longer the protagonist |

`deep-sim-design` covers exactly this (individual vs field) and should be run
before committing.

## Mechanics identified at filing

- **Frequency-dependent payoff against TWO opponents** — host silencing and rival
  families. Not one arms race, two, and they interact.
- ⚠️ **piRNA clusters are built from captured element fragments**, so inserting
  into one conscripts you into your own suppression. **The trap is made of you.**
  This is the mechanic most worth getting right and most likely to be wrong if
  taken from a summary rather than the pathway.
- **Domestication as an ALTERNATE WIN** — syncytin, RAG. Ceasing to be a parasite
  is a way to persist. A design with only "spread or die" throws this away.

## Should double as a research asset

TE data is open and abundant, so the model can be checked against reality rather
than only against itself: Petersen arthropod repertoires, Asparagales,
**Dfam/Repbase**.

⚠️ Those are pointers from the filing note, not verified facts about current
contents. Query a live registry before asserting what any of them holds or
whether a given comparison already exists.

## Prior grounding that already exists — read before re-running it

➡️ **SUPERSEDED IN PART by [`REFERENCES.md`](REFERENCES.md) (built 2026-09-02).**
That file carries 34 registry-verified works, the null model this roadmap lacks
(Charlesworth & Charlesworth 1983), a calibration number for the piRNA trap
(cluster size >0.2% of genome), and a **re-derived artifact-gap finding that
contradicts the second bullet below**. Read it before the brainstorm.

A sweep on **2026-07-31** (`bio_sim_candidates_grounded_2026-07-31.md` §1, in the
`-home-mjarnold` memory dir) already covered this candidate. Two results the rest
of this roadmap does not carry, both worth having before the brainstorm:

- ⚠️⚠️ **"Genome as ecosystem" is the FIELD'S OWN framing, not a fresh lens.**
  Brookfield, _Nat Rev Genet_, "The ecology of the genome"; PMID 17188821; PLOS
  Genet 2021 on the maize TE genomic ecosystem. Pop-gen is mature here too
  (Bourgeois & Boissinot 2019, Blumenstiel 2019, Hua-Van 2011, Lü & Clark 2009 on
  piRNA). That sweep recorded pitching the framing as its own and being wrong —
  **the concept gap is closed, so novelty cannot be claimed there.**
- ⛔ **STALE — this bullet's conclusion no longer holds. See `REFERENCES.md` §7.**
  It said the surviving ARTIFACT gap was wide, naming only `SimulaTE`
  (10.1093/bioinformatics/btx772, reads for benchmarking) and `VisualTE` (a static
  GUI). Both check out, but the sweep **missed SLiM 4** (Haller & Messer 2022, 378
  cites — a forward simulator with a GUI already used for TE work), and **three
  more TE simulators have appeared since**: TESS (2025-06), TEvarSim (2026-01),
  TEgenomeSimulator (2026-03). The defensible gap is now much narrower — every one
  of these is a batch instrument (parameters in, dataset out), none is watchable
  mid-run, perturbable, or playable. That is a claim about INTERACTION MODE, not
  capability, and it is the only version the evidence supports.
- It also named a counterfactual knob with real cross-taxon measurement behind it:
  **disable silencing → genome bloat.**

⚠️ **Neither bullet discharges the prior-art item below.** Both are >30 days old,
and the artifact-gap one is an absence claim — it has to be re-derived against a
live registry and the null stated as "checked HERE", naming where.

## Not yet done

- [ ] Brainstorm the design (`superpowers:brainstorming`, then `deep-sim-design`)
- [ ] Settle the unit of individuality and record WHY
- [ ] Find a player verb that respects "rate is heritable, not chosen"
- [~] `bio-grounding` on piRNA conscription and on domestication, against the
  actual pathways rather than the summary — **literature base built
  (`REFERENCES.md` §3, §5); the pathway mechanics themselves still need
  reading past the abstracts.**
- [~] Prior-art check against live registries, with the null stated as "checked
  HERE" rather than "not found" — **done for OpenAlex + WebSearch 2026-09-02
  (`REFERENCES.md` §7). STILL OPEN: GitHub topics, PyPI, CRAN, itch.io, Steam.
  The null over those is NOT established.**
- [ ] Resolve or drop the unverified "Blumenstiel 2019" citation (`REFERENCES.md` §9)
- [ ] Verify Dfam / Repbase access terms and the Asparagales pointer
      (`REFERENCES.md` §8) — both unchecked
- [ ] First registered question + pre-registration, before any runner exists
